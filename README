bunsen-exit
===========

Two packages are built:

bunsen-exit: Logout dialog box with various options, using yad as GUI.

bunsen-exit-python: Python script providing the same functionality,
but with a more attractive GUI, and more configurability.

Both packages provide the bl-exit command, and may not be installed together.
