===========

bunsen-exit: Logout dialog box with various options, using yad as GUI.

NOTE: this package used python2 and GTK2 and is no longer built:

bunsen-exit-python: Python script providing the same functionality,
but with a more attractive GUI, and more configurability.

Both packages provided the bl-exit command, and could not be installed together.
