# default button configuration for bl-exit
# CASE:
#   Use only lowercase
# WARNING:
#   Do not overwrite this file.
#   It is a Debian conf file and may be changed by the package manager when
#   a new version of bunsen-utilities is released.
# CONFIGURATION:
#   To configure bl-exit buttons, copy this file to
#      $HOME/.config/bl-exit/bl-exitrc
#   and edit it according to your wishes.
#   It is possible to group configurations for several buttons by adding a
#      [default]
#   section. All buttons that do not have a specific section will take the
#   show and onerror values from this default section.
#   show can take the values always | never | maybe
#   onerror can take the values visual | novisual for feedback on error.
